Analysis on effective population size of L. braziliensis populations across South America

### R functions used for downstream G-PhoCS analyses
Functions are definced in gphocs_Rfunctions.R

## Points to elaborate on:

- Data to run G-phocs is added.
- script and functions for downstream analyses in R are provided.

- Data is an subset of the entire data that is analysed
	- only used on 1 subset of individuals and two models (No migration and bi-directional)
	- Perhaps only a few or ALL chromosomes are added.
